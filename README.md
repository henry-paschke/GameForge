# GameForge

Gameforge is a game development library designed to unify game engine development tools in C++. It is very much a work in progress, but the eventual goal is to 
add support for every major game development tool.

# What GameForge does

When developing games without an engine, often a lot of boilerplate code is needed that takes a significant time to write. GameForge aims to collect all that boilerplate code together in an easy to use package, in a format that gives the user free choice over how the code is used.

# Supported Frameworks 

These frameworks either partially or fully have GameForge support and integration:
* SDL2/3
* SFML
* OpenGL 
* CGLM/GLM
* Chipmunk
